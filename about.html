      <h1 style="color:#830019";> About Me </h1>
      I received a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Delaware and an M.S. and D.Sc. in Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis.  I have been on the faculties at Indiana University, the Ohio State University, Florida Southern College, and currently, the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse.   

      <p>I enjoy hiking in the mountains (not in Florida) and photography, hence the banner photos on this site.  My sons and I are fans of The Grand Tour (formerly Top Gear) and English Premiere League football.

        <li> My academic genealogy:
        <ul>
          <li> My disertation advisor was Sally Goldman at Washington University
          <li> Sally's dissertation advisor was Ron Rivest at MIT.  Rivest is a recipient of the ACM Turing Award.
          <li> Ron's dissertation advisor was Bob Floyd at Stanford.  Floyd is a recipient of the ACM Turing Award.
          <li> Bob didn't have a dissertation advisor.  He didn't write a dissertation because he didn't have a doctorate.  Donald Knuth has written that, "When I drafted the material for a monograph on the subject of parsing in 1966, I came to the conclusion that only five really good papers about compilers had been written so far, and Bob had been the author of all five."
        </ul>

        <li> My h-index is 9.
      </ul>
