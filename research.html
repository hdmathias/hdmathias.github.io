      My research field is genetic algorithms, an area of Artificial Intelligence in which we create algorithms that "evolve" solutions to computationally expensive problems.  A genetic algorithm is a computational corollary to Darwinian evolution.  A population of candidate solutions to a problem are recombined and mutated, all at random, to create increasingly better solutions over a number of generations.

      <p> The video below (by Matthew Miller via youtube) provides a visual example of a genetic algorithm.  In this case, the algorithm creates an approximation of the Mona Lisa by randomly placing circles created with random size and color.  The purpose of the video is to demonstrate the power of genetic algorithms not to provide a real-world example of how they are used.  It's worth noting that the video is time-compressed -- the actual computation took approximately a week.

      <p>The whole thing works due to an objective function, a mechanism for evaluating the fitness of an individual (candidate solution).  As in biological evolution's survival of the fittest, fitter individuals are more likely to survive, allowing them to reproduce and/or mutate, while less fit individuals are more likely to be eaten by a lion.

      <p> My recent work has focused on several applications of genetic algorithms.  In one project, we use genetic algorithms to do path planning for autonomous vehicles, namely micro aerial vehicles, popularly known as drones. Not only is this an interesting problem but it also allows my students and I to play with quadcopters which is, frankly, a lot of fun.  Pictured below is a 3DR Iris+ like those we fly.  We have incorporated an Odroid XU4 single-board computer allowing all necessary computation to be done onboard the vehicle, making it autonomous.

        <p> Students and I are also working on several other problems.  The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma considers cooperative behaviors.  We have examined the impact of including stubbornly uncooperative members in a population for IPD.  In an extension of this work, we have recently begun to apply similar techniques to the Pollution Game, which models international environmental agreements.  In a project suggested by recent news coverage, a student and I are evolving both passenger and airline strategies for the overbooking problem.  In this problem, airlines want to minimize the number of passengers who must be involuntarily removed from flights while passengers want to maximize their reward for voluntarily giving up their seats.  In a CREU project, generously funded by the Computing Research Association, a team of students along with Dr. Roberson, Dr. Elva and I are creating an AI controller for the Ghost Team in the Ms. Pac-Man game.
