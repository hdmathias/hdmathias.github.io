          <h3 style="margin-left: 20px"> CS Lab </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 20px">
          The Department of Computer Science operates a computer lab for students in CS courses in Wing Technology Center 16.  The computers in that room are setup with the tools you need for the programming assignments in CS 120.  You may also take your laptop if you prefer. </p>
          
          <h4 style="margin-left: 20px"> Lab Hours </h4>
          <p style="margin-left: 20px">
          Regular lab hours will begin on Sunday September 9.  The schedule will be posted here when available. </p>

          <h3 style="margin-left: 20px"> Study Sessions </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 20px">
              Several times throughout the week, the CS Lab is staffed with students who are available to help you with assignments in CS 120.  This is a valuable resource, please be sure to take advantage of it if you are struggling with an assignment or topics in the course.  You can also go to the lab at these times even if you don't have questions.  The schedule will be posted here when avaiable. </p>
          
          
          <h3 style="margin-left: 20px"> Installing Java </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 20px">
              Java is available for free in the form of the JDK -- Java Development Kit.  You can <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">download the JDK</a> from Oracle.  Be sure to click the download button for JDK, NOT the JRE. The newest version of JDK (as of September 3, 2018) is 10.0.2. </p>
          
          <h3 style="margin-left: 20px"> Installing Eclipse </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 20px">
              There are many tools that will allow you to edit Java code.  While you are welcome to use any of them on your computer, in lab we will use Eclipse.  Eclipse is a free Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  IDEs allow you to write and run code from within a single program.  The current version is Eclipse Photon, which can be <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">downloaded from the developer, </a> Eclipse.org. Installation is painless. </p>
          

          <h3 style="margin-left: 20px"> Using Eclipse </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 20px">
              The department has a set of tutorials to help familiarize you with Eclipse.  Though they were not created for the most recent version, they should be very helpful.  You can find them <a href="https://faculty.cs.uwlax.edu/~jjhursey/teaching/tutorial/eclipse/"> here.</a>  Thanks to Dr. Josh Hursey for sharing these. </p>
