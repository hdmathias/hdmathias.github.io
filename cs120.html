          <h3 style="margin-left: 20px"> Programming Assignments </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 20px">
          One of he largest components of your grade in this course is outside-of-class programming assignments.  The only way to learn how to program is by programming.  You will not be successful in this class unless you write your own code.  I encourage you to study with others and to discuss concepts and ideas with classmates.  However, you must write and submit your own work. 
          <ul id="pubs_list">
              <li>Programs are due at 11:59 PM on the due date.  There is a long and proud tradition of programs being due at that time.  You are, of course, welcome to submit well before the deadline. </li>
              
              <li>Late submission are accepted up to 72 hours after they are due.  Up to 24 hours late, there is a 20\% penalty.  Up to 48 hours late, there is a 30\% penalty.  Up to 72 hours late, there is a 40\% penalty. </li>
              
              <li>Include, at the top of your program file, a block comment with the following information (in this order): your name, the assignment number, the due date, and a brief description of the assignment. </li>
              
              <li>Comment your code (we'll discuss in class what this means).  You will be tempted to skip this.  Resist that temptation. Good commenting is critical. </li>
              
              <li>Adhere to the coding conventions we discuss in class.  I don't care that your uncle's wife's cousin told you to do things a different way.  There are many ways to format code and I don't claim that my way is the right way but it will be much easier for us to talk about code if we all use a common format. </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 style="margin-left: 20px"> In-class Programming </h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 20px">
              One day each week, we will meet in the CS department lab, 16 Wing Technology Center.  During these sessions, you will be given a manageable programming assignment to complete.  You are encouraged to work in pairs.  While completion of the assignment is the goal, credit will be given based on making a good faith effort to solve the problem. </p>
